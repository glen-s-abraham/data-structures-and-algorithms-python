2 types->Directed and undirected graphs.
Hamiltonian path-It's a path in an undirected 
graph that visits each vertex exactly once.Hamiltonian
cycle is a hamiltonian path that is a cycle.
Determining wether such paths and cycles exists in a graph
is NP-complete.We use simulations to solve the problem.
Travelling salesman problem relies on Hamiltonian cycles
TSP Problem:given a list of cities and the distances between
each pair of cities,what is the shortest possible route that
visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.
If there is a hamiltonian path for graph:it's the solution for
the TSP.
Eulerian path-It's a trail in a graph which visits every
edge ecaxtly once.Eulerian cycle is a Eulerian trail which
starts and ends on the same vertex.An undirected graph has
an eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree.
We can construct graphs that has eulerian cycles with Heirhozler
algorith.important for the cinese postman p[roblem.
Cinese postman problem:a postman needs to go through every street
at least once+closed circuit+wants to find shortest path.
If there is a eulerian cycle that is the solution fot the cpp.
